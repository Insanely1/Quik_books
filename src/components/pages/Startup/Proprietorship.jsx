        <p className="intro">
          Starting a proprietorship is one of the simplest ways to launch a business in India. 
          A proprietorship is owned, managed, and controlled by a single person – the proprietor. 
          As the proprietor and the business are one and the same, it has minimal compliance requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
          Proprietorships cannot have partners or shareholders, and there is no limited liability protection. 
          This structure works best for small businesses with less than 5 employees. 
          ComFilings can help you register your proprietorship online, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free process.

        <h2>Sole Proprietorship Registration in India</h2>
        <p>
          There is no formal government registration for proprietorships. 
          Recognition comes through tax registrations, such as GST, under the proprietor's name. 
          ComFilings guides you to complete the entire registration process online, ensuring compliance and recognition.
